## Installation

pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage

Run

python Pushup_counter.py
```

It a very simple python script. Just run it and it will run the video and show the count in the video itself. If you want to exit the video just press q.

If you want to use it for live counting then just change the input from "pushup_2.mp4" to 0 (for default camera) or 1 or sorthing else depending on your device setting.
